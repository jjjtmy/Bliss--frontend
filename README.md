## Key Challenges/Takeaways
* Keeping track of what requests and responses each function has  - used clear namings and commented in the code to properly identify inputs and handle the responses
* Familiarising with using a different UI library - used a combination of the documentation and inspect tool in browser to identify the selectors and props

## Next Steps
* Improve user experience such as providing more details in autocomplete such as address and ratings
* Include more vendor categories apart from venues such as photogprahers and makeup artists
* Use Google Maps API to render map directly on each vendor's page
